# What are these decorators?
I think every front-end developer has seen code written in Angular. This framework has certainly introduced decorators to the mainstream, but it is not their only use. We write things that begin with "@" also in MobX, "react-redux" and there are examples from Vue and Stencil.

I want to show what the first version of decorators was about and how to build them. Moreover, I will provide the overview of the current decorators proposal.
