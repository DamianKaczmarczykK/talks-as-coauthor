# Participant's starter pack

Perform the setup before the workshop, please.

## Setup

* [ ] Ensure your microphone and camera are fine.
* [ ] Ensure having IDE and programming language you want to use. Recommended - IntelliJ and _Code With Me_ plugin
  (works fine even for non-JVM languages).
* [ ] Check how _Code With Me_ works for you. Test it quickly with any of your teammates if you never used it before.
    * [ ] https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/code-with-me.html
    * [ ] You might upgrade your IntelliJ to make sure it works.
    * [ ] Start Session with checked "Full access" and unchecked "Start call" (it's probably better to use Slack for
      voice communication).
* [ ] Ensure Slack huddles work for you.
    * [ ] On Mac ensure Slack is allowed in System Settings -> Privacy & Security: Microphone, Screen Recording.
* [ ] Prepare "raw" projects/starters - just with proper programming languages and testing tools.
    * [ ] Consider using https://github.com/swkBerlin/kata-bootstraps or something similar.
    * [ ] Quick workaround for JVM - https://start.spring.io/ and project with no dependencies (testing tools added by
      default).
    * [ ] Consider installing newer version of your programming language than you normally use.
