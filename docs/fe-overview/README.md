"New day, new framework". How to handle this?

I follow front-end trends and I want to share my thoughts on them. Both experienced front-end developers and the beginners, expecting a quick summary, should find something valuable for them in my talk.

What are the main front-end players? Is Vue more popular than React? Can we use some kind of a common, framework-independent code? What are the trends and what is the future of JavaScript? I will do my best to address these questions in an entertaining way.
