# My personal front-end overview (2018)

"New day, new framework". Have you heard it? In my short talk I'll try to show that the situation is not that bad. There are 3 main players and 2 main concepts across all the frontend frameworks.

Why React wins with Angular? How about Vue? Are there any other big players? What is going on with jQuery? What are the trends and what is the future of the front-end? I will do my best to address those questions in an entertaining way.
